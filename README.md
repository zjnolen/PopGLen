# Landscape genomics of *Polyommatus icarus*

The focus of this project is a genomic comparison between *P. icarus* populations in grasslands with differing levels of habitat abundance in the surrounding landscape.

As of now, this repository will be for working out a Snakemake pipeline for processing the raw sequencing data to get some early general comparisons of these populations - PCA, Admixture, and Nucleotide Diversity.
