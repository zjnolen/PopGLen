#===================== Reference Configuration ========================#

# Before using your reference it is important it meets certain 
# requirements for downstream analyses. The first is that it should be 
# uncompressed, or, if compressed, only in bgzip format (from samtools).
# The second is that scaffold names should be concise (10-15 char.) 
# with only letters, numbers, and underscores.
#
# chunk_size - Most analyses can be run per scaffold and merged later
# If a value is given, the genome will be broken into chunks of roughly
# this size which will be analyzed in parallel when appropriate. In the 
# current implementation, scaffolds will not be split if they roll over 
# the chunk size, instead, it will fit however many whole scaffolds it 
# can in that chunk. This may be improved later on.
#
# fasta - A string with the absolute or relative path to a local copy of
# the fasta.
#
# mito - Scaffold containing mitochondria, will be excluded 
# from autosomal analyses. Leave blank if not present in reference or 
# cannot be identified.
#
# XZ - Scaffold(s) that are a part of XZ chromosomes. Will be excluded 
# from autosomal analyses and included in sex-chromosome analyses.
#
# exclude - Scaffold(s) to exclude (i.e. abnormally sex-linked, lower-
# quality) from all analyses. Scaffolds smaller than the min_size 
# option don't need to be specified here.
#
# min_size - Scaffolds shorter than this number (bp) will be excluded.

#===================== Sample Set Configuration =======================#

# Sometimes you will want to exclude individuals from downstream 
# analyses (too low coverage, relatives in dataset, duplicated), but do 
# not want to remove them from the sample list. List these individuals 
# here and they will be removed.

#==================== Downsampling Configuration ======================#

#====================== Analysis Selection ============================#
# Here you select what steps in the pipeline you would like to perform.
# Individual and dataset level analyses are performed for all 
# individuals in the dataset. 'populations' option can take a list of 
# populations to perform population level analyses on. If this is left
# empty, population level analyses will be performed for each unique
# population name in the sample list, excluding single sample 
# populations in analyses that are biased by or do not support them.
