# Landscape genomics pipeline for Polyommatini butterflies

The focus of this project is a genomic comparison between populations in 
grasslands with differing levels of habitat abundance in the surrounding 
landscape, as well as between populations from the same location in differing 
time periods. This is a work in progress with the goal being to make it so that 
the project can be reproduced using this pipeline, while also generalized 
enough that it can be run for different sample sets by exchanging the sample 
list and reference genome.
