<h1 id="general-settings">General Settings</h1>
<p>In the <a href="../config"><code>config</code></a> directory, you will find template configuration
files for this pipeline. For your run, you'll need to edit <code>samples.tsv</code>,
<code>units.tsv</code>, and <code>config.yaml</code>.</p>
<h2 id="samples-list">Samples list</h2>
<p>All your samples should be listed in <code>samples.tsv</code>. Samples preceded with a <code>#</code>
will not be included, this can be useful if you want to exclude a sample after
quality checking.</p>
<p>Each sample must have four columns filled in the sample sheet. The columns are
tab separated:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sample</code> - The name of the sample</li>
<li><code>population</code> - The populations you will group your samples into. These are
  the groups that population level stats are calculated on.</li>
<li><code>time</code> - This should be either <code>modern</code> or <code>historical</code>, the only thing this
  will affect is whether or not your bam files will be corrected for
  post-mortem damage or not.</li>
<li><code>depth</code> - This is only used for depth filtering. Extreme levels (both high
  and low) will be calculated for each group you put here as well as the
  dataset as a whole, and all will be filtered out for all analyses. Any string
  can be used for this. If all samples are sequenced to roughly similar depths,
  all can have the same value. If some are low coverage, and some higher,
  simply using 'low' and 'high' on the corresponding samples is sufficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>The values in the sample list will end up in filenames, so ensure that they are
only characters permitted in filenames on your system.</p>
<h2 id="units-list">Units list</h2>
<p>All your raw data will be pointed to in <code>units.tsv</code>.</p>
<p>Each row will contain a sample 'unit', this is a unique combination of a
sample, sequencing run, and library. As such, these columns, as well as a
fourth for the sequencing platform are required:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sample</code> - The sample name, same as in <code>samples.tsv</code>.</li>
<li><code>unit</code> - This describes the sequencing platform unit. The expected format is
  <code>sequencerbarcode.lane</code>. It will be used to fill the <code>PU</code> readgroup, and
  combined with the <code>lib</code> column to fill the <code>ID</code> read group.</li>
<li><code>lib</code> - This is used to fill out the <code>LB</code> read group and combined with <code>unit</code>
  to fill out the <code>ID</code> read group. This should be a unique identifier for each
  library. Sequencing runs from the same library, but different runs, will have
  the same value in <code>lib</code>, but different in <code>unit</code>.</li>
<li><code>platform</code> - This is used to fill out the <code>PL</code> read group. Put what you'd
  want there. Usually <code>ILLUMINA</code> for Illumina platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you have three ways to specify sequencing data sources. You can
provide fastq files available locally on your machine, an SRA run accession to
automatically download fastq files from NCBI, or a fully processed bam file.
Only one of these three categories of columns need to be defined. If multiple
are, the pipeline will prefer bam files &gt; local fastq files &gt; SRA accessions.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fq1</code> and <code>fq2</code> - The absolute or relative paths from the working directory
  to the raw fastq files for the sample. Currently the pipeline only supports
  paired-end sequencing, so both columns are neede. Single end may be added
  down the line if requested.</li>
<li><code>sra</code> - A short read run accession. Since NCBI and ENA mirror each other, the
  run accession can come from either. Only supports paired-end runs. These are
  treated as temporary and deleted after trimming, unlike local fastq files,
  which we never delete.</li>
<li><code>bam</code> - If you do not want to map the raw reads, provide a pre-processed
  BAM file path here. Samples with a BAM file may only appear once in the units
  list, so multiple sequencing runs should be merged beforehand. If a BAM file
  is listed, <code>fq1</code> and <code>fq2</code> are ignored, and the BAM file is used for that
  sample.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Your dataset can include both samples that start at FASTQ and at BAM. If
a BAM is listed, it will be used instead of mapping, but if not, the FASTQ
files will be mapped.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-file">Configuration file</h2>
<p><code>config.yaml</code> contains the configuration for the workflow, this is where you
will put what analyses, filters, and options you want. Below I describe the
configuration options. The <a href="../config/config.yaml"><code>config.yaml</code></a> in this
repository serves as a template, but includes some 'default' parameters that
may be good starting points for some users. If <code>--configfile</code> is not specified
in the snakemake command, the workflow will default to <code>config/config.yaml</code>.</p>
<h3 id="configuration-options">Configuration options</h3>
<h4 id="dataset-configuration">Dataset Configuration</h4>
<p>Required configuration of the 'dataset'.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>samples:</code> An absolute or relative path from the working directory to the
  <code>samples.tsv</code> file.</li>
<li><code>units:</code> An absolute or relative path from the working directory to the
  <code>units.tsv</code> file.</li>
<li><code>dataset:</code> A name for this dataset run - essentially, an identifier for a
  batch of samples to be analysed together with the same configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, dataset means a set of samples and configurations that the workflow will
be run with. Each dataset should have its own <code>samples.tsv</code> and <code>config.yaml</code>,
but the same <code>units.tsv</code> can be used for multiple if you prefer. Essentially,
what the dataset identifier does is keeps your outputs organized into projects,
so that the same BAM files can be used in multiple datasets without having to
be remade.</p>
<p>So, say you have <code>dataset1_samples.tsv</code> and <code>dataset2_samples.tsv</code>, with
corresponding <code>dataset1_config.tsv</code> and <code>dataset2_config.yaml</code>. The sample
files contain different samples, though some are shared between the datasets.
The workflow for dataset1 can be run, and then dataset2 can be run. When
dataset2 runs, it map new samples, but won't re-map samples processed in
dataset1. Each will perform downstream analyses independently with their sample
set and configuration files, storing these results in dataset specific folders.</p>
<h4 id="reference-configuration">Reference Configuration</h4>
<p>Required configuration of the reference.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>chunk_size:</code> A size in bp (integer). Your reference will be analyzed in
  'chunks' of contigs of this size to parallelize processing. This size should
  be larger than the largest contig in your genome. A larger number means fewer
  jobs that run longer. A smaller number means more jobs that run shorter. The
  best fit will depend on the reference and the compute resources you have
  available. Leaving this blank will not divide the reference up into chunks
  (but this isn't optimized yet, so it will do a couple unnecessary steps).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>reference:</code></p>
</li>
<li><code>name:</code> A name for your reference genome, will go in the file names.</li>
<li><code>fasta:</code> A path to the reference fasta file (currently only supports
    uncompressed fasta files)</li>
<li><code>mito:</code> Mitochondrial contig name(s), will be removed from analysis. Should
    be listed within brackets []</li>
<li><code>sex-linked:</code> Sex-linked contig name(s), will be removed from analysis.
    Should be listed within brackets []</li>
<li><code>exclude:</code> Additional contig name(s) to exclude from analysis. Should be
    listed within brackets []</li>
<li>
<p><code>min_size:</code> A size in bp (integer). All contigs below this size will be
    excluded from analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ancestral:</code> A path to a fasta file containing the ancestral states in your
  reference genome. This is optional, and is used to polarize allele
  frequencies in SAF files to ancestral/derived. If you leave this empty,
  the reference genome itself will be used as ancestral, and you should be
  sure the [<code>params</code>] [<code>realSFS</code>] [<code>fold</code>] is set to <code>1</code>. If you put a reference
  here, you can set that to <code>0</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Reference genomes should be uncompressed, and contig names should be clear and
concise. Currently, there are some issues parsing contig names with
underscores, so please change these in your reference before running the
pipeline. Alphanumeric characters, as well as <code>.</code> in contig names have been
tested to work so far, other symbols have not been tested.</p>
<p>Potentially the ability to use bgzipped genomes will be added, I just need to
check that it works with all underlying tools. Currently, it will for sure not
work, as calculating chunks is hard-coded to work on an uncompressed genome.</p>
<h4 id="sample-set-configuration">Sample Set Configuration</h4>
<p>This will exclude individuals from analysis that are listed in the sample list.
This may be useful if you run the workflow and find a poor quality sample, and
want to re-run without it. Or if you have relatives in the dataset and you want
to exclude them where necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>exclude_ind:</code> Sample name(s) that will be excluded from the workflow. Should
  be a list in [].</li>
<li><code>excl_pca-admix:</code> Sample name(s) that will be excluded <em>only</em> from PCA and
  Admixture analyses. Useful for close relatives that violate the assumptions
  of these analyses, but that you want in others. Should be a list in [].</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="analysis-selection">Analysis Selection</h4>
<p>Here, you will define which analyses you will perform. It is useful to start
with only a few, and add more in subsequent workflow runs, just to ensure you
catch errors before you use compute time running all analyses. Most are set
with (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>) or a value, described below. Modifications to the
settings for each analysis are set in the next section.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>populations:</code> A list of populations found in your sample list to limit
  population analyses to. Might be useful if you want to perform individual
  analyses on some samples but not include them in any population level
  analyses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>analyses:</code></p>
</li>
<li><code>mapping:</code><ul>
<li><code>historical_only_collapsed:</code> Historical samples are expected to have
  fragmented DNA. Overlapping (i.e. short) read pairs are collapsed in this
  workflow, and while both overlapping and non-overlapping read pairs are
  mapped for modern samples, setting this option to <code>true</code> will only map
  the collapsed, overlapping read pairs for historical samples. This can
  help avoid mapping contaminants, as longer fragments are likely from more
  recent, non-endogenous DNA. However, in the event you want to map both,
  you can set this to <code>false</code>. (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>historical_collapsed_aligner:</code> Aligner used to map collapsed historical
  sample reads. <code>aln</code> is the recommended for this, but this is here in case
  you would like to select <code>mem</code> for this. Uncollapsed historical reads
  will be mapped with <code>mem</code> if <code>historical_only_collapsed</code> is set to
  <code>false</code>, regardless of what is put here. (<code>aln</code>/<code>mem</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>genmap:</code> Filter out sites with low mappability estimated by Genmap
  (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>repeatmasker:</code> (NOTE: Only one of the three options should be filled/true)<ul>
<li><code>bed:</code> Supply a path to a bed file that contains regions with repeats.
  This is for those who want to filter out repetitive content, but don't
  need to run Repeatmodeler or masker in the workflow because it has
  already been done for the genome you're using. Be sure the contig names
  in the bed file match those in the reference supplied. GFF or other
  filetypes that work with <code>bedtools subtract</code> may also work, but haven't
  been tested.</li>
<li><code>local_lib:</code> Filter repeats by masking with an already made library you
  have locally (such as ones downloaded for Darwin Tree of Life genomes).
  Should be file path, not a URL.</li>
<li><code>dfam_lib:</code> Filter repeats using a library available from dfam. Should be
  a taxonomic group name.</li>
<li><code>build_lib:</code> Use RepeatModeler to build a library of repeats from the
  reference itself, then filter them from analysis (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>extreme_depth:</code> Filter out sites with extremely high or low global
    sequencing depth. Set the parameters for this filtering in the <code>params</code>
    section of the yaml. (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>dataset_missing_data:</code> A floating point value between 0 and 1. Sites with
    data for fewer than this proportion of individuals across the whole dataset
    will be filtered out.</li>
<li><code>population_missing_data:</code> A floating point value between 0 and 1. Sites
    with data for fewer than this proportion of individuals in any population
    will be filtered out for all populations.</li>
<li><code>qualimap:</code> Perform Qualimap bamqc on bam files for general quality stats
    (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>damageprofiler:</code> Estimate post-mortem DNA damage on historical samples
    with Damageprofiler (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>) NOTE: This just adds the addition of
    Damageprofiler to the already default output of MapDamage.</li>
<li><code>mapdamage_rescale:</code> Rescale base quality scores using MapDamage2 to help
    account for post-mortem damage in analyses (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>) <a href="https://ginolhac.github.io/mapDamage/">docs</a></li>
<li><code>estimate_ld:</code> Estimate pairwise linkage disquilibrium between sites with
    ngsLD for each popualation and the whole dataset. Note, only set this if
    you want to generate the LD estimates for use in downstream analyses
    outside this workflow. Other analyses within this workflow that require LD
    estimates (LD decay/pruning) will function properly regardless of the
    setting here. (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>ld_decay:</code> Use ngsLD to plot LD decay curves for each population and for
    the dataset as a whole (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>pca_pcangsd:</code> Perform Principal Component Analysis with PCAngsd
    (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>admix_ngsadmix:</code> Perform admixture analysis with NGSadmix (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>relatedness:</code> Can be performed multiple ways, set any combination of the
    three options below. Note, that I've mostly incorporated these with the
    R0/R1/KING kinship methods in Waples et al. 2019, <em>Mol. Ecol.</em> in mind.
    These methods differ slightly from how they implement this method, and will
    give slightly more/less accurate estimates of kinship depending on your
    reference's relationship to your samples. <code>ibsrelate_ibs</code> uses the
    probabilities of all possible genotypes, so should be the most accurate
    regardless, but can use a lot of memory and take a long time with many
    samples. <code>ibsrelate_sfs</code> is a bit more efficient, as it does things in a
    pairwise fashion in parallel, but may be biased if the segregating alleles
    in your populations are not represented in the reference. <code>ngsrelate</code> uses
    several methods, one of which is similar to <code>ibsrelate_sfs</code>, but may be
    less accurate due to incorporating in less data. In my experience,
    NGSrelate is suitable to identify up to third degree relatives in the
    dataset, but only if the exact relationship can be somewhat uncertain (i.e.
    you don't need to know the difference between, say, parent/offspring and
    full sibling pairs, or between second degree and third degree relatives).
    IBSrelate_sfs can get you greater accuracy, but may erroneously inflate
    kinship if your datset has many alleles not represented in your reference.
    If you notice, for instance, a large number of third degree relatives
    (KING ~0.03 - 0.07) in your dataset that is not expected, it may be worth
    trying the IBS based method (<code>ibsrelate_ibs</code>).<ul>
<li><code>ngsrelate:</code> Co-estimate inbreeding and pairwise relatedness with
  NGSrelate (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>ibsrelate_ibs:</code> Estimate pairwise relatedness with the IBS based method
  from Waples et al. 2019, <em>Mol. Ecol.</em>. This can use a lot of memory, as
  it has genotype likelihoods for all sites from all samples loaded into
  memory, so it is done per 'chunk', which still takes a lot of time and
  memory. (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>ibsrelate_sfs:</code> Estimate pairwise relatedness with the SFS based method
  from Waples et al. 2019, <em>Mol. Ecol.</em>. Enabling this can greatly increase
  the time needed to build the workflow DAG if you have many samples. As a
  form of this method is implemented in NGSrelate, it may be more
  efficient to only enable that. (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>1dsfs:</code> Generates a one dimensional site frequency spectrum for all
    populations in the sample list. Automatically enabled if <code>thetas_angsd</code> is
    enabled. (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>1dsfs_boot:</code> Generates N bootstrap replicates of the 1D site frequency
    spectrum for each population. N is determined from the <code>sfsboot</code> setting
    below (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>2dsfs:</code> Generates a two dimensional site frequency spectrum for all unique
    populations pairings in the sample list. Automatically enabled if
    <code>fst_angsd</code> is enabled. (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>1dsfs_boot:</code> Generates N bootstrap replicates of the 2D site frequency
    spectrum for each population pair. N is determined from the <code>sfsboot</code>
    setting below (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>thetas_angsd:</code> Estimate pi, theta, and Tajima's D for each population in
    windows across the genome using ANGSD (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>heterozygosity_angsd:</code> Estimate individual genome-wide heterozygosity
    using ANGSD. Calculates confidence intervals from bootstraps.
    (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>fst_angsd:</code> Estimate pairwise $F_{ST}$ using ANGSD. Set one or both of the
    below options. Estimates both globally and in windows across the genome.<ul>
<li><code>populations:</code> Pairwise $F_{ST}$ is calculated between all possible
  population pairs (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>individuals:</code> Pairwise $F_{ST}$ is calculated between all possible
  population pairs. NOTE: This can be really intensive on the DAG building
  process, so I don't recommend enabling unless you're certain you want
  this (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>inbreeding_ngsf-hmm:</code> Estimates inbreeding coefficients and runs of
    homozygosity using ngsF-HMM. Output is converted into an inbreeding measure
    $F_ROH$, which describes the proportion of the genome in runs of
    homozygosity over a certain length. (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>ibs_matrix:</code> Estimate pairwise identity by state distance between all
    samples using ANGSD. (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="downsampling-section">Downsampling Section</h4>
<p>As this workflow is aimed at low coverage samples, its likely there might be
considerable variance in sample depth. For this reason, it may be good to
subsample all your samples to a similar depth to examine if variation in depth
is influencing results. To do this, set an integer value here to subsample all
your samples down to and run specific analyses.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>subsample_dp:</code> A mean depth to subsample your reads to. This will be done
  per sample, and subsample from all the reads. If a sample already has the
  same, or lower, depth than this number, it will just be used as is in the
  analysis. (INT)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>subsample_redo_filts:</code> Make a separate filtered sites file using the
  subsampled bams to calculate depth based filters. If left disabled, the
  depth filters will be determined from the full coverage files.
  (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>subsample_analyses:</code> Individually enable analyses to be performed with the
  subsampled data. These are the same as the ones above in the analyses
  section. Enabling here will only run the analysis for the subsampled data,
  if you want to run it for the full data as well, you need to enable it in the
  analyses section as well. (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="filter-sets">Filter Sets</h4>
<p>By default, this workflow will perform all analyses requested in the above
section on all sites that pass the filters set in the above section. These
outputs will contain <code>allsites-filts</code> in the filename and in the report.
However, many times, it is useful to perform an analysis on different subsets
of sites, for instance, to compare results for genic vs. intergenic regions,
neutral sites, exons vs. introns, etc. Here, users can set an arbitrary number
of additional filters using BED files. For each BED file supplied, the contents
will be intersected with the sites passing the filters set in the above
section, and all analyses will be performed additionally using those sites.</p>
<p>For instance, given a BED file containing putatively neutral sites, one could
set the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">filter_beds:
  neutral-sites: &quot;resources/neutral_sites.bed&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, for each requested analysis, in addition to the <code>allsites-filts</code>
output, a <code>neutral-filts</code> (named after the key assigned to the BED file in
<code>config.yaml</code>) output will also be generated, containing the results for sites
within the specified BED file that passed any set filters.</p>
<p>More than one BED file can be set, up to an arbitrary number:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">filter_beds:
  neutral: &quot;resources/neutral_sites.bed&quot;
  intergenic: &quot;resources/intergenic_sites.bed&quot;
  introns: &quot;resources/introns.bed&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>It may also sometimes be desireable to skip analyses on <code>allsites-filts</code>, say
if you are trying to only generate diversity estimates or generate SFS for a
set of neutral sites you supply. To skip running any analyses for
<code>allsites-filts</code> and only perform them for the BED files you supply, you can
set <code>only_filter_beds: true</code> in the config file. This may also be useful in the
event you have a set of already filtered sites, and want to run the workflow on
those, ignoring any of the built in filter options by setting them to <code>false</code>.</p>
<h4 id="software-configuration">Software Configuration</h4>
<p>These are software specific settings that can be user configured in the
workflow. If you are missing a configurable setting you need, open up an issue
or a pull request and I'll gladly put it in.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mapQ:</code> Phred-scaled mapping quality filter. Reads below this threshold will
  be filtered out. (integer)</li>
<li>
<p><code>baseQ:</code> Phred-scaled base quality filter. Reads below this threshold will be
  filtered out. (integer)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>params:</code></p>
</li>
<li><code>clipoverlap:</code><ul>
<li><code>clip_user_provided_bams:</code> Determines whether overlapping read pairs will
  be clipped in BAM files supplied by users. This is useful as many variant
  callers will account for overlapping reads in their processing, but ANGSD
  will double count overlapping reads. If BAMs were prepped without this in
  mind, it can be good to apply before running through ANGSD. However, it
  essentially creates a BAM file of nearly equal size for every sample, so
  it may be nice to turn off if you don't care for this correction or have
  already applied it on the BAMs you supply. (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>genmap:</code> Parameters for mappability analysis, see <a href="https://github.com/cpockrandt/genmap/">GenMap's documentation</a>
    for more details.<ul>
<li><code>K:</code></li>
<li><code>E:</code></li>
<li><code>map_thresh:</code> A threshold mappability score. Sites with a mappability
  score below this threshold are filtered out if GenMap is enabled.
  (integer/float, 0-1)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>extreme_depth_filt:</code> Parameters for excluding sites based on extreme high
    and/or low global depth. The final sites list will contain only sites that
    pass the filters for all categories requested (i.e the whole dataset
    and/or the depth categories set in samples.tsv).<ul>
<li><code>method:</code> Whether you will generate extreme thresholds as a multiple of
  the median global depth (<code>"median"</code>) or as percentiles of the
  global depth distribution (<code>"percentile"</code>)</li>
<li><code>bounds:</code> The bounds of the depth cutoff, defined as a numeric list. For
  the median method, the values will be multiplied by the median of the
  distribution to set the thresholds (i.e. <code>[0.5,1.5]</code> would generate
  a lower threshold at 0.5*median and an upper at 1.5*median). For the
  percentile method, these define the lower and upper percentiles to filter
  out (i.e [0.01,0.99] would remove the lower and upper 1% of the depth
  distributions). (<code>[ FLOAT, FLOAT]</code>)</li>
<li><code>filt-on-dataset:</code> Whether to perform this filter on the dataset as a
  whole (may want to set to false if your dataset global depth distribution
  is multi-modal). (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>filt-on-depth-classes:</code> Whether to perform this filter on the depth
  classes defined in the samples.tsv file. This will generate a global
  depth distribution for samples in the same category, and perform the
  filtering on these distributions independently. Then, the sites that pass
  for all the classes will be included. (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>fastp:</code><ul>
<li><code>extra:</code> Additional options to pass to fastp trimming. (string)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>picard:</code><ul>
<li><code>MarkDuplicates:</code> Additional options to pass to Picard MarkDuplicates.
  <code>--REMOVE_DUPLICATES true</code> is recommended. (string)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>angsd:</code> General options in ANGSD, relevant doc pages are linked<ul>
<li><code>gl_model:</code> Genotype likelihood model to use in calculation
  (<code>-GL</code> option in ANGSD, <a href="http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Genotype_Likelihoods">docs</a>)</li>
<li><code>maxdepth:</code> When calculating individual depth, sites with depth higher
  than this will be binned to this value. Should be fine for most to leave
  at <code>1000</code>. (integer, <a href="http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Depth">docs</a>)</li>
<li><code>extra:</code> Additional options to pass to ANGSD during genotype likelihood
  calculation at all times. This is primarily useful for adding BAM input
  filters. Note that <code>--remove_bads</code> and <code>-only_proper_pairs</code> are enabled
  by default, so they only need to be included if you want to turn them
  off or explicitly ensure they are enabled. I've also found that for some
  datasets, <code>-C 50</code> and <code>-baq 1</code> can create a strong relationship between
  sample depth and detected diversity, effectively removing the benefits of
  ANGSD for low/variable depth data. I recommend that these aren't included
  unless you know you need them. Since the workflow uses bwa to map,
  <code>-uniqueOnly 1</code> doesn't do anything if your minimum mapping quality is
  &gt; 0. Don't put mapping and base quality thresholds here either, it will
  use the ones defined above automatically. Although historical samples
  will have DNA damaged assessed and to some extent, corrected, it may be
  useful to put <code>-noTrans 1</code> or <code>-trim INT</code> here if you're interested in
  stricter filters for degraded DNA. (string, <a href="http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Input#BAM.2FCRAM">docs</a>)</li>
<li><code>extra_saf:</code> Same as <code>extra</code>, but only used when making SAF files (used
  for SFS, thetas, Fst, IBSrelate, heterozygosity includes invariable
  sites).</li>
<li><code>extra_beagle:</code> Same as <code>extra</code>, but only used when making Beagle and Maf
  files (used for PCA, Admix, ngsF-HMM, doIBS, ngsrelate, includes only
  variable sites).</li>
<li><code>snp_pval:</code> The p-value to use for calling SNPs (float, <a href="http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/SNP_calling">docs</a>)</li>
<li><code>domajorminor:</code> Method for inferring the major and minor alleles. Set to
  1 to infer from the genotype likelihoods, see <a href="https://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Major_Minor">documentation</a>
  for other options. <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>4</code> can be set without any additional
  configuration. <code>5</code> must also have an ancestral reference provided in the
  config, otherwise it will be the same as <code>4</code>. <code>3</code> is currently not
  possible, but please open an issue if you have a use case, I'd like to
  add it, but would need some input on how it is used.</li>
<li><code>domaf:</code> Method for inferring minor allele frequencies. Set to <code>1</code> to
  infer from genotype likelihoods using a known major and minor from the
  <code>domajorminor</code> setting above. See <a href="http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Allele_Frequencies">docs</a>
  for other options. I have not tested much beyond <code>1</code> and <code>8</code>, please open
  an issue if you have problems.</li>
<li><code>min_maf:</code> The minimum minor allele frequency required to call a SNP.
  This is set when generating the beagle file, so will filter SNPs for
  PCAngsd, NGSadmix, ngsF-HMM, and NGSrelate. If you would like each tool
  to handle filtering for maf on its own you can set this to <code>-1</code>
  (disabled). (float, <a href="http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Allele_Frequencies">docs</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>ngsld:</code> Settings for ngsLD (<a href="https://github.com/fgvieira/ngsLD">docs</a>)<ul>
<li><code>max_kb_dist_est-ld:</code> For the LD estimates generated when setting
  <code>estimate_ld: true</code> above, set the maximum distance between sites in kb
  that LD will be estimated for (<code>--max_kb_dist</code> in ngsLD, integer)</li>
<li><code>max_kb_dist_decay:</code> The same as <code>max_kb_dist_est-ld:</code>, but used when
  estimating LD decay when setting <code>ld_decay: true</code> above (integer)</li>
<li><code>rnd_sample_est-ld:</code> For the LD estimates generated when setting
  <code>estimate_ld: true</code> above, randomly sample this proportion of pairwise
  linkage estimates rather than estimating all (<code>--rnd_sample</code> in ngsLD,
  float)</li>
<li><code>rnd_sample_decay:</code> The same as <code>rnd_sample_est-ld:</code>, but used when
  estimating LD decay when setting <code>ld_decay: true</code> above (float)</li>
<li><code>fit_LDdecay_extra:</code> Additional plotting arguments to pass to
  <code>fit_LDdecay.R</code> when estimating LD decay (string)</li>
<li><code>fit_LDdecay_n_correction:</code> When estimating LD decay, should the sample
  size corrected r^2 model be used? (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>, <code>true</code> is the
  equivalent of passing a sample size to <code>fit_LDdecay.R</code> in ngsLD using
  <code>--n_ind</code>)</li>
<li><code>max_kb_dist_pruning_dataset:</code> The same as <code>max_kb_dist_est-ld:</code>, but
  used when linkage pruning SNPs as inputs for PCAngsd, NGSadmix, and
  NGSrelate analyses. Pruning is performed on the whole dataset. Any
  positions above this distance will be assumed to be in linkage
  equilibrium during the pruning process. (integer)</li>
<li><code>pruning_min-weight_dataset:</code> The minimum r^2 to assume two positions are
  in linkage disequilibrium when pruning for PCAngsd, NGSadmix, and
  NGSrelate analyses. (float)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>ngsf-hmm:</code> Settings for ngsF-HMM<ul>
<li><code>estimate_in_pops:</code> Set to <code>true</code> to run ngsF-HMM separately for each
  population in your dataset. Set to <code>false</code> to run for whole dataset at
  once. ngsF-HMM assumes Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (aside from inbreeding)
  in the input data, so select the option that most reflects this. You can
  use PCA and Admixture analyses to help determine this. (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>prune:</code> Whether or not to prune SNPs for LD before running the analysis.
  ngsF-HMM assumes independent sites, so it is preferred to set this to
  <code>true</code> to satisfy that expectation. (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>)</li>
<li><code>max_kb_dist_pruning_pop:</code> The maximum distance between sites in kb
  that will be treated as in LD when pruning for the ngsF-HMM input. (INT)</li>
<li><code>pruning_min-weight_pop:</code> The minimum r^2 to assume two positions are in
  linkage disequilibrium when pruning for the ngsF-HMM input. Note, that
  this likely will be substantially higher for individual populations than
  for the whole dataset, as background LD should be higher when no
  substructure is present. (float)</li>
<li><code>min_roh_length:</code> Minimum ROH size in base pairs to include in inbreeding
  coefficient calculation. Set if short ROH might be considered low
  confidence for your data. (integer)</li>
<li><code>roh_bins:</code> A list of integers that describe the size classes in base
  pairs you would like to partition the inbreeding coefficient by. This can
  help visualize how much of the coefficient comes from ROH of certain size
  classes (and thus, ages). List should be in ascending order and the first
  entry should be greater than <code>min_roh_length</code>. The first bin will group
  ROH between <code>min_roh_length</code> and the first entry, subsequent bins will
  group ROH with sizes between adjacent entries in the list, and the final
  bin will group all ROH larger than the final entry in the list. (list)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>realSFS:</code> Settings for realSFS<ul>
<li><code>fold:</code> Whether or not to fold the produced SFS. Set to 1 if you have not
  provided an ancestral-state reference (0 or 1, <a href="http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/SFS_Estimation">docs</a>)</li>
<li><code>sfsboot:</code> Determines number of bootstrap replicates to use when
  requesting bootstrapped SFS. Is used for both 1dsfs and 2dsfs (this is
  very easy to separate, open an issue if desired). Automatically used
  for heterozygosity analysis to calculate confidence intervals. (integer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>fst:</code> Settings for $F_{ST}$ calculation in ANGSD<ul>
<li><code>whichFst:</code> Determines which $F_{ST}$ estimator is used by ANGSD. With 0
  being the default Reynolds 1983 and 1 being the Bhatia 2013 estimator.
  The latter is preferable for small or uneven sample sizes
  (0 or 1, <a href="http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Fst">docs</a>)</li>

<li><code>win_step:</code> Window step size in bp for sliding window analysis (integer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>ngsadmix:</code> Settings for admixture analysis with NGSadmix. This analysis is
    performed for a set of K groupings, and each K has several replicates
    performed. Replicates will continue until a set of N highest likelihood
    replicates converge, or the number of replicates reaches an upper threshold
    set here. Defaults for <code>reps</code>, <code>minreps</code>, <code>thresh</code>, and <code>conv</code> can be left
    as default for most.<ul>
<li><code>kvalues:</code> A list of values of K to fit the data to (list of integers)</li>
<li><code>reps:</code> The maximum number of replicates to perform per K (integer)</li>
<li><code>minreps:</code> The minimum number of replicates to perform, even if
